FIELD OF SPECIALIZATION: Peptide Hormone Biosynthesis, HPLC of Proteins
and Spider Silk Protein Structure.

My major interest is the biosynthesis of bioactive peptides. At present
this focus is on the enkephalin biosynthesis in adrenal chromaffin granules.
This involves comparison between several species and the isolation of the
‘enzyme(s) responsible for the proteolytic cleavages. In addition, the
possible presence of other bioactive peptides in these chromaffin granules
is being investigated by purifying these peptides.

The other major research effort is directed toward determining the
amino acid sequences of the proteins that comprise different spider silks
and correlating these sequences to the unique physical properties of these

silk fibers.

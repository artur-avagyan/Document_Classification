MAN hag been providing @ steady strean of information to columnists, editorial
writers and others, We've seen a few good editorials recently that have focused
fon the bigger picture. Cleveland Plain Dealer (8/3) mentioned IN lawsuit
victory, E2A, PDA, Chicago advertising victory, 3,000 kids controversy and
Vermont product liability law and concluded: "Zf the industry has understated
the hazards of swoking, its critics well may have avorstated the benefits and
wisdom of their solutions. The hazards of manipulating science, of abandoning
long-held legal principles, of trampling informed debate go beyond the tobacco
business. That's all the moze reason to give thom a full hearing in the tobacco
debate.

on this week's MAN call, we held this up for all fizms as evidence of the
xeaults that can be acheived through regular contact and persistance with the
media. We will share Detroit News and Cleveland editorials with all firms,

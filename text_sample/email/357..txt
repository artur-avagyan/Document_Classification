We definitely want to have We Card materials at booth. Maybe we should have some samples or examples of
promotional materials for training seminars (fiers, invites, efc,) singe in my remarks we will be encouraging
them to help promote training.

We can ship the booth out to Dallas. The dimensions are about 16' wide. Or, we can create &'pilon out ofthe.
back panels, but you can't see all four sirategies(panels) that way. Can we get more space?

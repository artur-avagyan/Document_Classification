Monday, December 13 looks good for everyone however, there is a 50% chance that Terry
has a conflict. So, may I ask that everyone put a tentative hold on this date pending final word
from Terry next Monday as it's the only date that has a chance before next year.

thanks.

KD: Although | haven't heard from you officially, your calendar is clear on that day.

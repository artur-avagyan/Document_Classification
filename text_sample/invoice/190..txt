PROPOSAL: This proposes the national introduction of WINSTON King Prototype #3775-C as a

replacenent for the current product. The improved product is rated at parity to Marlboro King
‘among target competitive male smokers aged 18-34, and was also rated superior to the current
WINSTON King product among this target group, thus representing a substantial improvement over
the current product. Prototype #3775-C utilizes a more expensive, higher density tow item
which will produce a significantly firmer filter providing the following important benefits:
1) Increased overall product consistency and quality, providing a uniformly round, firm
filter on all cigarettes; 2) Increased manufacturing efficiency by reducing tow item
"blowout," a problem with the current low density tow item; 3) Reduction of filter
collapse during the smoke; the filter remains firm throughout the smoke and a more
consistent draw should be obtained; and 4) Is fully competitive with Marlboro as it provides
the sane filter firmness, tow density, plasticizer, and tactile "feel" as Marlboro.

National manufacturing of Prototype #3775-C 1s, scheduled to begin April 11, 1983, with
approval of this AR form.

OBJECTIVES:
The objective of this product proposal is to introduce a WINSTON King blend that achieves
parity versus Marlboro King among target competitive snokers.

Enclosed herewith are the updates for your Smoking
Restriction Matrix. Since this matrix was last
updated, only four (4) minor laws have been enacted
which inpact on the tobacco industry. As you know,
the Smoking Restriction Matrix documents all of the
stoking restriction laws enacted in the 50 states
and the District of Columbia.

The summary is presented in two formats. The yellow
page summarizes in one chart those areas in each
state where smoking is restricted,

The statutory material (green pages) is presented
in a more elaborate format, presenting an enumera-
tion of smoking restriction laws in each of the
states and the District of Columbia by cite to the
respective state code, the source of each of the
laws (bill or session’law), and a short summary
of the language at each cite.

Please insert the enclosed four (4) pages into

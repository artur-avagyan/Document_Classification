Dear Mr. Thomas:

Howard Mitchell, who has been very successful working with
local governmental agencies in the San Diego region toward. the
adoption of legislation regulating smoking in indoor public places
and places of employment, suggested to me that it might be useful
to your office to have some information from the City of San Diego
on how we have attempted to implement our municipal ordinance per-
taining to: smoking.

I am taking the liberty of enclosing a copy of the San Diego
City ordinance, which you probably already have, plus some bro-
chures and correspondence and City Manager's Reports which you
might find useful.

We have concentrated our efforts on public awareness and vol-
untary compliance, and that is why, the assignment was given to the
Department of Citizens Assistance & Information instead of a law
enforcement agency. .

We have =njoyed the cooperation of the business community,
which worked :ith us toward an ordinance which we felt represented
@ reasonable -ompromise. After helping us draft such an ordinance,
the various organizations im the business community have assisted
us with the iwplementation. The County of San Diego and most of
the cities wishin the County have adopted legislation which is
virtually identical with the San Diego ordinance, and this, of
course, has enhanced our ability to help the public understand
what the law requires.

We have -ixperienced excellent cooperation with very little law-
enforcement ‘iletoric being employed. We have exhibited tolerance
to give the private sector time to understand and work with the

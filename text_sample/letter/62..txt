Dear Mrs. Zack:

Thank you so much for your interest in Satin
cigarettes. We are terribly sorry you hed diffi-
culty reaching our toll free number for free Satin
cigarettes and a Satin pouch. The response to this
offer was so overwhelming that inspite of our having
close to 500 operators answering calls around the
clock, there were still busy signals!

I have personally added your name to receive our
Satin offer, which will arrive as soon as possible.
In the meantime, I'm enclosing a coupon packet for
Satin valued at $2.35.

I know you'll enjoy the smooth, silky taste of Satin,
and I thank you for your understanding and patience.

Sincerely,
any he Ke it

, Mary Anfie Kayiatos
Satin Brand Manager

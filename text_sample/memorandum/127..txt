The Tobacco Products Control and Non-Smoker's Rights Act was enacted
on June 28th, 1988. This was the first federal law to regulate the tobacco
industry of Canada since 1908.

‘The Tobacco Products Control Act:

* Bans all cigarette advertising and promotion in newspapers and
magazines, effective January 1, 1989; on billboards after January 1, 1991,
and at points of sale after January 1, 1993.

* Severely restricts brand-name tobacco promotions and sports
sponsorship; prohibits the distribution of free samples and contests, prizes,
rebates, and the use of tobacco brand names on non-tobacco items, such as
t-shirts, mugs and hats.

+ Requires prominent health warnings on packs and billboards, listing
toxic ingredients, and also mandating enclosed health-information leaflets
in cigarette packages,

+ Requires manufacturers to provide the government with data on toxins
in tobacco and tobacco smoke and data on sales, advertising and promotion
of tobacco products.

* Weakens tobacco manufacturers defenses against smokers’ lawsuits by
barring companies from using government-mandated warnings as a
product liability shield if the companies had known of but failed to disclose
particular additional health hazards relevant to the litigation.

* Establishes a penalty for a single violation of the law of up to $250,000.

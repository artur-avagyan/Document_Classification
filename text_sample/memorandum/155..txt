BaH Ultra Lights - Distributor Test Market Shares

Attached is an update of the B&H Deluxe Ultra Lights market shares based
on distributor movement over the past 20 weeks. The DUL shares are
summarized in Tables 1 and 2,

During the weeks of 7/9-7/23, the total volume reported to us by the
Mackoul was incorrect. As a result the shares shown during those weeks
were artificially high. The correct shares have now been reported, and
the 7-distributor averages have been lowered accordingly.

We plan to continue updating this report weekly. If you have any
questions, please call.

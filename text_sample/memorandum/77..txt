OELAYED DILUTION CIGARETTE/Helf. 582-534 and 555/PM 509 an

fe raven

These two patents on the controlled profile cigaret (TamoT)
are coming up for renewal in a number of foreign countries and the
maintenance fees for the tenth year are beginning to be substantial.
For example, those for Great Britain, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland
for each case would total about $600 and that for Germany would be
nearly $200 exclusive of agents’ commissions (the other countries
on the attached list have much lower annuities).

We would recommend discontinuing maintenance and would
Tike to have your views.

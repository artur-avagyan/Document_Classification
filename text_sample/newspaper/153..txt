- Smoking Patterns at Radcliffe

and Harvard College*

BENJAMIN G. FERRIS, JR, MD.t

— "IT HAS been estimated: that Americans 17
years of age or older reported 12 million more
clonic ailments during.a test year than would.
have been reported had they not smoke
There were 300,000 extra cases of coronary
artery disease, a million extra cases of bron-
chitis and emphysema, and another million
extra cases of peptic ulcer. In the same report
it was estimated that time lost from work be-
cause of cigarette smoking “could run into
billions of dollars.”

No doubt, young persons smoking earlier and
more heavily contributed to this finding. It
‘seems reasonable that a search for early effects
of smoking in a young population might yield
results that could be used in efforts to dissuade
young people from commencing the habit of
smoking. This report deals with one segment of
a larger investigation conducted at Harvard
University.

A logical frst step in such an undertaking is
to assess the extent of smoking. How many
students smoke when they arrive at college?
How many start smoking while at college?
How many quit smoking while at college? How
‘many students smoke when they leave?

METHODS AND MATERIALS

Population of Study - Graduates of Radcliffe
and Harvard College for the years 1963, 1964
and 1965 were studied. The commencement
programs for these three years served as defin-
itive rosters of students who would be evalu-
ated.

Sources of Data - All entering freshmen dur-
ing their initial physical examination had been
asked about their smoking habits and the an-
swers had been recorded in their medical ree-
ords. From this source, smoking habits on
virtually all students beginning with their fresh-
man year were available. During the senior
year just prior to graduation, a questionnaire on
‘smoking habits was sent to all prospective grad-
uates. This questionnaire requested information
on current and lifetime smoking habits, includ-
ing the duration of smoking. In the spring of
1965, questionnaires were again sent to 1963
and 1964 graduates who were in the Harvard
graduate schools of Business, Law, Medicine,
and Arts and Sciences. From these sources it
was then possible to determine the lifetime
smoking patterns of each student.

RESULTS
Harvard freshmen- Smoking habits were
available on all'1960-1961 freshmen who were
in the graduating classes of 1964 and 1965., OF
the 1,059 graduates in 1964, 822 or 77.5 per
cent were nonsmokers. In the class of 1965,
796 of 1,089 or 73 per cent were nonsmokers.

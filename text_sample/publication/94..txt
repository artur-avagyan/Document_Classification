‘The effect of ozone (03) on xenobiotic metab-
olism was first suggested when it was found
that the administration of Oy to hamsters re=
sulted in an inhibition of benzpyrene hydrox-
ylase metabolism (Palmer et al, 1971). Fol-
lowing 1 ppm of Os for 3 hr to female mice,
a prolongation of pentobarbital sleeping time,
by 50%, was reported (Gardner er al, 1974),
Ozone also produced a S0% decrease in the
total P-450 content of the rabbit lung (Gold-
stein et al, 1975). This effect is species non-
specific but may be sex specific i is seen in

sensitive or substantially less sensitive than fe-
‘males (Graham et al, 1981).

‘As previous investigators have studied only
young animals, a study to investigate age as a
Variable on the effect of O, on xenobiotic
elimination kinetics would be valuable, since
an age effect on xenobiotic metabolism and
toxicity appear likely (Dieke and Richer,
1945; Kato et al, 1964; Rikans, 1984), In ad-
dition, the study was carried out in the New
Zealand White rabbit a species similar to hu-
‘mans in the anticipated bronchiolar dose of
5 (Miller er al, 1978), AS a sexctelated dif.
ference in susceptibility to the ozone inhibition
‘of pentobarbital sleeping time had been
shown, it was decided to include both males
and females, and mature and young rabbits in
this study. The elimination kinetics of the-
ophylline were chosen as the indicators of m

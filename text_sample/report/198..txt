CONSIDERATION OF. PLASTICIZER SUBSTITUTION
AS ONE METHOD TO AUGMENT NICOTINE IN. SMOKE

Submitted by: _Neil A. thaggara

Report number: Date:_april 13, 1977

Summary or Abstract:

The function of plasticizers on cigarette filter rods
is discussed. Available data show that triethylene glycol
diacetate transfers at a lower rate into mainstream smoke
than triacetin. It is recommended that the effect of tri-
acetin and triethylene glycol diacetate on nicotine yield
in mainstream smoke be determined.

Objective: To develop methods by which to objectively and reliably
evaluate human responses to cigarettes, smoke constituents and
tobacco flavorants.

Results
1. Cognitive NERP study

Cognitive NERP experiments have been initiated with the goal of
utilizing these responses to discriminate differences among
flavorants. Employing a cognitive (cdd-ball) paradigm, pairs of
stimuli (natural menthol vg CO; and natural vs synthetic
menthol) are being presented to subjects at different probabil-
ities of occurrence (standard = 0.85 vs target = 0.15)
Preliminary evidence suggests that subjects are quite good at
discriminating between both the menthol and CO, and the natural
and synthetic menthol. That is, subjects are differentiating
the targets from the standards and a late positive component is
being recorded in response to the targets that is not found in
the standards. Statistical analyses comparing the target and
standard NERPs are currently being conducted as a means of
quantifying the differences in the responses.

Blans: Immediate plans are to test ten subjects in the cognitive
Paradigm comparing natural menthol to CO, and synthetic to natural
menthol. Further plans include the testing of mixtures of natural
and synthetic menthol, d-menthol, (+)-isomenthol and other yet-to-be
determined menthoi-like compounds.
